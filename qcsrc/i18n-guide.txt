How to make the .po template:

find . -type f -not -name \*.po -not -name \*.txt | xgettext -LC -k_ -f- --from-code utf-8


How to compare the .po template against a language file:

msgcmp ../../menu.dat.de.po messages.po


How to merge the .po template into a language file:

msgmerge -U ../../menu.dat.de.po messages.po


Guideline:
- do NOT translate strings in error() messages, or in dprint()!
- delete obviously useless developer prints while at it
- change obvious developer prints from print to dprint (even in comments),
  unless in developer-only functions (e.g. *dumptree*)
- mark translatable strings with _()
- if a translatable string is a strcat monster, change it to sprintf
- if code loads files with text, use language_filename()
- interesting vim macros:
  :map # /"<return>
  :map ' i_(<esc>2f"a)<esc>/"<return>
