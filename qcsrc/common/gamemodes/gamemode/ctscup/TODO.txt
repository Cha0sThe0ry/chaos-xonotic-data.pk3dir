CTS Cup TODO list:

Round handler:
- Warmup and tournament start
- Round end conditions
- Move players to spectator after each tournament round

Savestates:
- Finish implementating savestates
- Hook up savestate saving to touching a checkpoint
- Delete savestates upon round reset
- I hope that loading a savestate from Damage_Calculate hook when player is about to die and setting incoming
damage to 0 can still save them and dying (for example by suicide bind) isn't a hardcoded death :)

HUD:
- Display current round's players
- Display splits
- Display how many players are about to lose this round and show that on splits
- Maybe show eliminated players on leaderboard, there should be a difference between 2nd place and Nth place for bragging rights
- Medals for placements?

Info messages:
- tournament in progress
- you survived the round and will continue to the next one
- you lost the round and got eliminated from the tournament
- upon elimination show placement
- upon savestate load tell that savestate was loaded
