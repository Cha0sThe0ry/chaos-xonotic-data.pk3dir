CTS Cup TODO list:

HUD:
- Display current round's players
- Display checkpoint splits
- Display how many players are about to lose this round and show that on splits
- Maybe show eliminated players on leaderboard, there should be a difference between 2nd place and Nth place for bragging rights
- Medals for placements?

Info messages:
- can not join, tournament in progress
- you survived the round and will continue to the next one
- you lost the round and got eliminated from the tournament
- upon elimination show placement
- upon savestate load tell that savestate was loaded
