add g_mh_startitem cvars to the balance files

+2 waypoint modes, 
waypoints for runners on round start always and waypoints for hunters when there are 3 or more hunters

rename teams as far as possible

find a proper damage type for tagging instead of death by camping as it doesn't show kill notifications or text

add a cvar to disable teleportating the first spawned hunter to where last runner got tagged on round reset

gamemode icon (WIP)

more dynamicity for the code :)

add more TODO: notes

if player(runner) taunts, his autotaunt time is restarted. something similar to "voice taunt"

fix waypoint visibility, currently they are always visible to everyone. Fix them to not be visible for spectators of that player.
