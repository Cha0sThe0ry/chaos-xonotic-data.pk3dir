decide names for teams, runners and hunters?

add g_mh_startitem cvars to the balance files

collision detection which kills the runner(?), check if goombastomp's or touchexplode's code is reusable

avoid players bumping into each other and losing speed regardless of team without affecting ^

teleport tagged players to where they got tagged / restore their velocity, coordinates and view angles

on-screen notification (and sound?) for getting tagged

add more TODO: notes
