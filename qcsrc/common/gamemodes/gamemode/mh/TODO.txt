add g_mh_startitem cvars to the balance files

+2 waypoint modes, 
waypoints for runners on round start always and waypoints for hunters when there are 3 or more hunters
only runners can see other runners but hunters don't see others

rename teams as far as possible

find a proper damage type for tagging instead of death by camping as it doesn't show kill notifications or text

on-screen notification for getting tagged

on-screen indication for your role

gamemode icon (WIP)

more dynamicity for the code :)

add more TODO: notes

it might need to improve something in Hunter black screen in mh.qh, sv_mh.qc uses HunterEyesStart function to execute black screen
g_mh_hunterblind 1 // to activate hunter black screen

fix waypoint visibility, currently they are always visible to everyone. Fix them to not be visible for spectators of that player.
