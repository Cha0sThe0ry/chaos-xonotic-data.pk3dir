everything xd

round based
create INFO_MH_JOIN_LATE based on INFO_CA_JOIN_LATE for the use of "newly joined player is only able to join the hunters for this round"
shuffle teams after every round
have players change teams upon dying
decide names for teams, runners and hunters?
mid-round joins go into hunters(?)
collision detection which kills the runner(?), check if goombastomp's or touchexplode's code is reusable
avoid players bumping into each other and losing speed regardless of team without affecting ^
score for hunters(?) for each kill and score for runners(?) for staying alive
on-screen notification (and sound?) for getting tagged
add more TODO: notes
